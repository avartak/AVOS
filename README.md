# AVOS
This is a hobby operating system currently under development. Work on this OS happens in my spare time. The aim is to learn about OS design, and all the details about coding an operating system into existence. The first goal is to have an OS targeting a 32-bit SMP x86 machine. Work on the kernel is only just starting, however, the bootloader is by now in a reasonably good shape. The bootloader code can be found in the [bootloader/](https://github.com/avartak/AVOS/tree/master/bootloader) folder.
